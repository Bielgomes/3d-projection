# 3D Projection in Python

![example gif](https://github.com/Bielgomes/3d-projection/blob/main/src/example/example.gif?raw=true)

## Description
This project demonstrates how to create a 3D projection of a cube using Python. The code uses the `pygame` library for rendering and the `numpy` library for matrix operations. The cube is represented by its vertices (points), and the projection is achieved through matrix multiplication and rotation.
